          update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. Older adults and
          people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or
          lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more
          serious complications from COVID-19 illness.

        <h2>Difference between COVID-19 & Flu</h2>
        <p>
          Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory
          illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is
          caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2), and
          flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. COVID-19 seems to
          spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some
          people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people
          can be contagious for longer. More information about differences
          between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below.
          Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may
          be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone,
          and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. While more is
          learned every day about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, there
          is still a lot that is unknown . This page compares COVID-19 and flu,
          given the best available information to date.
