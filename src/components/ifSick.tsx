        Steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if you are sick
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>Stay home except to get medical care</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Stay home. Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can
                recover at home without medical care. Do not leave your home,
                except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Take care of yourself. Get rest and stay hydrated. Take
                over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, to help you
                feel better.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical
                care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have
                any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an
                emergency.
              </p>

          <h2>Separate yourself from other people</h2>
          <p>
            As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other
            people and pets in your home. If possible, you should use a separate
            bathroom. If you need to be around other people or animals in or
            outside of the home, wear a mask.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Tell your close contacts that they may have been exposed to
            COVID-19. An infected person can spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours
            (or 2 days) before the person has any symptoms or tests positive. By
            letting your close contacts know they may have been exposed to
            COVID-19, you are helping to protect everyone.
          </p>

          <h2>Call ahead before visiting your doctor</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Call ahead. Many medical visits for routine care are being
                postponed or done by phone or telemedicine.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you have a medical appointment that cannot be postponed, call
                your doctorâ€™s office, and tell them you have or may have
                COVID-19. This will help the office protect themselves and other
                patients.

          <h2>Avoid sharing personal household items</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils,
                towels, or bedding with other people in your home.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Wash these items thoroughly after using them with soap and water
                or put in the dishwasher.
